Two players can see the ""real"" # (first one who picked it at random and third one who finally reports it) but a ""middleman"" can only report what the picker claims the # was. Because the compensation for these  three is solely dependent upon how big a # the third player's ""final"" report is, there is no rationale for reporting the actual number picked, other than honesty. If all three players report a high number they all get paid highest. Note that two other non-particpating players (4th and 5th) receive SMALLER payments based on the picked number versus reported number.",2,"Not sure why the compensation scheme was structured as it was (notably what the 4th and 5th ""passive"" players receive).
